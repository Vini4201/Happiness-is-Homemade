### General Info

The main objective of this project is to provide the elderly people of our society a diversion 
from their daily monotonous lives by providing various activities, some on a daily basis and 
some planned for a day or more with the help of volunteers.
It provides a platform to the elderly people who need to work even at this age, to take up less 
stressful jobs, avoid travelling and at the same time earn some income.
